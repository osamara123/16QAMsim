# Project 1: Simulation of 16QAM Modulation
This simulation aims at simulating the 16QAM modulation. The 16QAM is a quadrature modulation scheme, i.e., we have in-phase (real) and quadrature (imaginary) components. Each component is a 4ASK modulation with amplitudes picked from the set . The project is divided into two stages:
-Stage 1: Constructing the transmitter of the 16QAM, exploring the effect of noise on the constellation diagram of the 16QAM, and plotting the power spectral density of the 16QAM signal.
-Stage 2: Constructung the receiver of 16QAM, and plotting the BER curve versus .
General Logistics of the Project

# Stage 1: Constructing 16QAM Modulator Using Quadrature Modulator
-A viable code of the 16QAM transmitter.
-Plotting the constellation diagram of the 16QAM signal at  dB
-Plotting the PSD of the lowpass equivalent of the 16QAM signal.

# Stage 2: Constructing 16QAM Receiver and BER Curve
-A viable code of the 16QAM Receiver.
-Verification of that the Receiver outputs zero error with .
-Plotting the BER curve of the 16QAM versus  dB compared to the theoretical BER of 16QAM.
